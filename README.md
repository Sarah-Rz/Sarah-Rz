My name is Sara. I am passionate about Science, discovering all the Mysteries in the World, and becoming a useful Human Being. 
My personal skills: Accuracy, logical thinking, patience, Commitment to learning, and interest in computer science.

I studied Biology- genetics at IAU, Medical Branch in Tehran. 
Since I'm interested in different cultures and other languages as well, I learned German during my Studies. 
After graduating with a Bachelor of Science, I started my first Job as a trainee German Assistant Translator in an official translation Office in Tehran. After a few months, I was hired there as a full-time Translator. My Job was translating official Documents for an Embassy. There I worked on the computer around the clock and gradually became interested in professions related to computers. I wanted to use my Knowledge and Effort in the field of IT. 

I started my learning Journey as a self-taught first with YouTube, after that with FreeCodeCamp. 
I took the " JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures" course and practiced Day and Night. After 3 months, I took the "Responsive Web Design" course to improve my knowledge of frontend development, HTML, and CSS. After that, I started my third course on "frontend development libraries".
After finishing these 3 courses and creating some Projects and my Portfolio with JavaScript and React, I found a Digital Marketing Agency that created Websites for various Professions. This is where my first amazing Job experience in the field of IT began. 

After finishing my Internship as a Frontend Developer, I took an online course "Python for Everybody Specialization" at the University of Michigan to expand my Backend knowledge and learn Python programming, SQL, DataViz, DBMS, etc.

It took me a long way to finally find my dream job. When I am programming to solve a problem, it is like a goal that I want to achieve. At the end of the day, when I have solved the task, it's like I achieve my Goal every day! That's what programming means to me.

And now I'm looking for training as a developer in Germany to bring my programming skills to a higher level!
